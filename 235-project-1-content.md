## About MasterMind
MasterMind is a puzzle game, initially a board game, where a team makes a four-color code and the other team has to solve it with hints 
given by the opponent. In many digital cases, the code team is the computer, and the solving team is the user.

PROPOSAL
-------------------------------------------------------------

# MasterMind Proposal
## Concept
MasterMind is a 2-teamed puzzle game, initially a board game, where one team makes a four-color secret code and the other team 
has to try to figure out that code with hints given by the opponent. In many digital cases, the code team is the computer, and 
the solving team is the user.

## Platform
This game is currently only desktop compatable.

## Theme
This game doesn't have a story per se, but it does have a general theme for this version of the game, which is sort of man vs 
machine. Can the player figure out the secret code before they run out of turns?

## Style
The style will be kind of futuristic. The game board will look like a sort of circuit board, with LEDs lighting up based on player
selections and hints. sound design would be stereotypical machine noises -- that is: beeps, whistles, etc.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player can place any of the six available colors anywhere within the current row at any time. The computer will then give the 
player hints as to how many pieces the player got right. Hints given to help the player will not be able to stop them from making 
illogical decisions, that is up to the player to figure out.

### Control
Current plans have controls being done solely with the mouse.

### Teaching the Player
The rules for the game are fairly simple, so there will be a small onscreen HUD with the rules, and otherwise the player must 
figure out the nuance of the game by themselves.

### Player Learning
As the user plays multiple games, they will develop their own strategies as to solving the puzzles with minimum turn usage. 
For example, using colors multiple times in the same guess help eliminate outside variables on the specific theory they would 
be currently testing. This strategy comes with experience, but will not be taught in any way.
